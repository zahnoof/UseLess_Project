Project Description
This project is a dynamic, interactive website designed to enhance user engagement through hover and bounce animations. As users move their cursor across the screen, images subtly respond by hovering, creating a sense of depth and interactivity. When the cursor pauses or clicks on an image, the image then animates with a bounce effect, adding playful motion to each interaction.

The goal of this website is to create an intuitive, visually appealing experience that encourages exploration. These interactions are made possible through a combination of CSS, JavaScript, and possibly lightweight animation libraries, ensuring smooth transitions without compromising performance.

In the current website design, the intended bounce effect on images when clicked is not functioning. While images successfully respond with hover animations as the cursor moves over them, there is no additional bounce animation triggered upon clicking an image. This issue disrupts the interactive experience by missing a key element of the intended design, which aims to enhance user engagement with dynamic, responsive visual feedback.

The goal is to troubleshoot and implement the click-based bounce effect, ensuring that the images perform the intended animation smoothly when clicked. This will complete the desired interactive flow and contribute to a more engaging user experience.
